Documenation and Instructions
---

<p>To demonstrate the integration with the CA Automic One Automation Platform, we built a blockchain sample application using the <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/">Hyperledger Composer</a> that gets executed on the <a href="https://hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Fabric platform</a>.<br /><br />The application introduces blockchain technology to the (fictional) Middle-Earth Real Estate Properties Market.</p>
